The goal of this research is to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware,
based on different properties of that machine. It is really important to find out whether the computer is infected and cure it.
We have a huge dataset of data, where most features are categorical. I think that correct mean encoding should be important. 
Also, the number of columns is quite high so it could be tempting to make some automatically processing for all columns. I 
personally think that it is important to analyze each variable and it could help to do a better processing.
Motivation behind this research is, I found a way to develop it as a full stack automated Data Science project which can useful
for future data sets of malware predictions.

## What is Business Goal <a class="anchor" id="Business_Goal"></a>

Business goal is to predict the predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware, for predicting this we have given a train and test data set with more than a billion observations.

## How will the solution be used?<a class="anchor" id="Solution"></a>

This predicition model can be used to protect end users systems from the Malware attacks.

## How to frame the problem?<a class="anchor" id="Problem_Hypothesis"></a>

This problem can be solved using a supervised learning approach, and possible some unsupervised learning methods.

## What models are we implementing?<a class="anchor" id="Optimizing_Solution"></a>

- The models we are using here are:
- **1** Sequential Neural-network 
- **2** Decision Tree Classifier and ROC for considered models
