The goal of this research is to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware,
based on different properties of that machine. It is really important to find out whether the computer is infected and cure it.
We have a huge dataset of data, where most features are categorical. I think that correct mean encoding should be important. 
Also, the number of columns is quite high so it could be tempting to make some automatically processing for all columns. I 
personally think that it is important to analyze each variable and it could help to do a better processing.
Motivation behind this research is, I found a way to develop it as a full stack automated Data Science project which can useful
for future data sets of malware predictions.
